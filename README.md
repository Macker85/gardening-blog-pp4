### Fonts

 The fonts selected were from Google Fonts, Roboto and Lato with sans-serif as a backup font. These were chosen as they are popular across alot of sites and will give a feeling of familiarity.

#### Website pages

The site was designed to have this feeling of familiarity for the user with the navigation bar along the top of the pages and a hamburger menu button for smaller screen.

The footer contains all relevant social media links to increase popularity with usage and increase the traffic.
